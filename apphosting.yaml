# Settings to manage and configure a Firebase App Hosting backend.

runConfig:
  maxInstances: 1

# The 'env' section is completely omitted for these variables.
# This means your running App Hosting backend WILL NOT have
# process.env.SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY or process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY available.
# Any code in your backend that relies on these environment variables
# will likely fail.

# The Firebase App Hosting build environment still implicitly sets FIREBASE_CONFIG
# and FIREBASE_WEBAPP_CONFIG for your client-side app.
# You will still need to ensure your client-side code correctly uses these.
